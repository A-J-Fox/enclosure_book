# Edgeworth Box diagrams

## Isoquant Edgeworth box plots

The model could be visualized on an Edgeworth Box isoquant diagram, and useful because it shows the effective $w/r$ (isocost lines) faced on unenclosed and enclosed sites.  

In our model thus far $G(T,L) = \theta \cdot F(T,L)$  but it might be interesting to argue that enclosure might facilitate the adoption of more labor-intensive technologies (e.g. irrigated crops, tree crops).  Otsuka and Place {cite}`otsuka2014` have a diagram describing such a Boserupian situation that we could provide microfoundations for in our model (click to show) diagram:
