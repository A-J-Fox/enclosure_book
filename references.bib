  abstract = {Statutory recognition of rural communities as collective owners of their lands is substantial, expanding, and an increasingly accepted element of property relations. The conventional meaning of property in land itself is changing, allowing for a greater diversity of attributes without impairing legal protection. General identified trends include: (1) declining attempts to deny that community lands are property on the grounds that they may not be sold or are owned collectively; (2) increased provision for communities to be registered owners to the same degree as individual and corporate persons; (3) a rise in number of laws catering specifically to the identification, registration and governance of community property; and (4) in laws that acknowledge that community property may exist whether or not it has been registered, and that registration formalizes rather than creates property in these cases. The research examined the laws of 100 countries to ascertain the status of lands which social communities, either traditionally or in more contemporary arrangements, deem to be their own. Sampling is broadly consistent with numbers of countries per region. The constitutions of all 100 countries were examined. The land laws of 61 countries were scrutinized. Secondary sources were used for 39 countries, mainly due to laws not being available in English. The main secondary source used was LandMark, whose data is publicly available at www.landmarkmap.org.},

While very active land markets did not increase inequality and urban informality remains low, combining administrative and survey data for Rwanda suggests that 5 years after completing first-time land registration, 87\% of rural transactions remain informal. Affected groups, especially women and the poor, may face higher likelihood of conflict and diminished access to digital services using land data. Respondents are aware of the need to register transactions and, on average, they are willing to pay about 2\% of land value to do so. Reforms to increase compliance by reducing rural fees to affordable levels (including a waiver for the poor) would be revenue-neutral but greatly enhance social welfare.},

Property rights range from open access to a fully specified set of private rights. By open access we mean that anyone can use the asset regardless of how their use affects the use of others. A full set of private rights consists of the following: 1) the right to use the asset in any manner that the user wishes, generally with the caveat that such use does not interfere with someone else's property right; 2) the right to exclude others from the use of the same asset; 3) the right to derive income from the asset; 4) the right to sell the asset; and 5) the right to bequeath the asset to someone of your choice. In between open access and private property rights are a host of commons arrangements. Commons arrangements differ from open access in several respects. Under a commons arrangement only a select group is allowed access to the asset and the use rights of individuals using the asset may be circumscribed. For example, a societal group, e.g., a village, tribe or homeowner's association, may allow its members to place cattle in a common pasture but limit the number of cattle that any member may put on the commons.},

This behavior is costly to the borrower, as it represents a net interest payment of about 24\% per year. While traditional explanations may partly explain this behavior, interviews with members of the cooperatives suggest the following new rationale: members resort to borrowing to signal to friends and relatives that they are poor and do not have savings available. By doing so, they can avoid requests for financial help. We develop a signaling model to analyze the conditions under which this behavior is an equilibrium outcome.},

In Ghana and other West African countries, privatization may also work in the opposite direction\textemdash reinforcing inequalities within communities, and encouraging claims to land based on origin and indigeneity.},

  abstract = {There is an ongoing debate on the effect different property regimes have on the use of natural resources and land conversion (i.e., deforestation or reforestation). Much of the discussion has been centered on the two main forms of tenure regime: common-pool system and private property. Case studies around the world have provided evidence on whether one is more effective at preventing deforestation than the other, but there is not a clear pattern. Part of the problem is that evidence comes from theoretical models or isolated case studies instead of comparative studies across large areas. This paper helps to fill this gap by analyzing the association between land cover change (2001\textendash 2010) and land tenure regimes including private and two types of common-pool systems (communal and ejido) in Mexico at the municipality level. The analyses were conducted for each of the four major biomes (i.e., moist forest, dry forest, coniferous forest, and desert) to control for differences in environmental factors. Municipalities dominated by communal land tenure had the largest increase in woody cover (classified as {$>$}80\% cover) in the moist forest, dry forest, and coniferous forest biomes, and municipalities classified as private also had an increase in woody cover, particularly in the desert biome. In contrast, municipalities classified as ejidos (common-pool tenure system resulting from the land reform) lost woody cover mostly in moist forest and desert biomes, but gained woody cover in dry forest and coniferous forest biomes. In modeling analyses, environmental variables were the most important variables associated with woody cover change for private and most communal municipalities, while socioeconomic variables were the most important in ejido regimes. These results highlight the importance of land tenure on land cover change, and show that differences in woody cover change between types of common-pool systems can be larger than their differences with private land tenure. During the last 10years, virtually all deforestation has occurred in areas dominated by ejidos; in contrast, communal and private regimes seem to ameliorate the deforestation process.},

In the early 19th century, the Northamptonshire poet John Clare took a good look at the countryside and didn't like what he saw. He wrote: "Fence meeting fence in owners little boundsOf field and meadow, large as garden-grounds,In little parcels little minds to please,With men and flocks imprisoned, ill at ease."Enclosure means literally enclosing a field with a fence or a hedge to prevent others using it. This seemingly innocuous act triggered a revolution in land holding that dispossessed many, enriched a few but helped make the agricultural and industrial revolutions possible. It saw the dominance of private property as the model of ownership, as against the collective rights of previous generations. For some Enclosure underpinned the economic and agricultural development of Modern Britain. But it has also been a cause celebre for the political left ever since Karl Marx argued that enclosures created the industrialised working class and ushered in the capitalist society. What really happened during the era of 18th and 19th century enclosures? Who gained, who lost and what role did Enclosures play in the agricultural and industrial transformation of this country?

Using a regression discontinuity design, I show that the divergent state laws of Ghana and C\^ote d'Ivoire have had little effect on de facto property rights institutions. In contrast, the data show that these states' laws and policies have had large impacts on other economic outcomes. Furthermore, I show that part of the substantial within-country variation in property rights institutions is explained by economic factors. Areas that are more suitable for growing cocoa have a greater prevalence of land transfer rights. My findings highlight the importance of nonstate sources of norms and show that these norms do, to some extent, evolve to accommodate the changing needs of society.},

In this paper, we show how a dominant political party can use insecure property rights to ensure politically compliant voter behavior and how this power is frustrated after the introduction of a land certification program. We test this hypothesis on data covering 10,000 Mexican municipal elections during the country's democratic transition. Exploiting the gradual rollout of a large-scale land certification program, we find that land titles significantly raised the number of votes for the main opposition parties. Importantly, this effect disappears once the dominant party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), has already lost at least one election in the municipality. These results provide an additional explanation of the PRI's downfall and, more generally, illuminate the relationship between political power, institutions and resource allocation.},

I find that economies with higher percentages of untitled land would have lower agricultural productivity; land titling can increase agricultural productivity by up to 82.5 percent.

  abstract = {This book aims to provide key pieces of information needed for informed debate about large-scale land acquisition by drawing on the experience from past land expansions, discussing predictions for potential future demand, and providing empirical evidence of what is happening on the ground in the countries most affected by the recent increase in demand for land. It complements demand side considerations with a detailed assessment of the amount of land, whether currently cultivated or not, that might potentially be available for agricultural cultivation at the global and country levels. It then describes in some detail the policies in place to manage land acquisition processes and analyzes how these policies may affect outcomes. This information can help governments in land abundant countries to assess how best to integrate increased demand for land into their rural development strategies and provide opportunities and benefits to all involved, including existing smallholders. This is particularly important as many of these countries also have high yield gaps. It also highlights how, in cases where land acquisition by large investors makes sense from a social, economic, and environmental perspective, governments can create an environment that can help to attract outside investment that contributes to broad-based growth and poverty reduction.},

We use household data from 6 countries to show that there is great potential for such markets to increase productivity and equalize factor ratios. While rental markets transfer land to land-poor and labor-rich producers, their operation and thus impact may be constrained by policy restrictions. Their functioning may also be constrained by ill-defined or insecure rights that may arise from failure to fully compensate existing rights in cases of expropriation, a failure to implement more broadly land policies or to do so in a gender sensitive manner. Methodological and substantive conclusions are derived.},

  abstract = {In most poor countries, small firms and self-employment are the dominant forms of business enterprise\textemdash even in the manufacturing sector. For rich countries, in contrast, self-employed people account for very small shares of manufacturing employment and output. This paper builds on Lucas [1978. On the size distribution of business firms. Bell Journal of Economics 9(2), 508\textendash 523] to ask whether structural changes of this kind are driven by productivity differences. A model, calibrated to Japanese time-series data, is shown to mimic key features of cross-country and time-series data. The results support the idea that changes in aggregate productivity account for much of the cross-country variation in establishment size and self-employment rates.},

Les cultivateurs qui, primitivement, \'etaient responsables du d\'eveloppement de la culture de cacao \`a l'\'echelle commerciale dans le Ghana m\'eridional n'\'etaient pas, comme on le suppose g\'en\'eralement, des fermiers qui avaient introduit la culture des cacaotiers dans leur syst\`eme traditionnel de culture des denr\'ees pour assurer leur subsistance, mais c'\'etaient des \'emigrants venus de la r\'egion au sud de la zone foresti\`ere qui avaient achet\'e le terrain pour cultiver le cacao et qui \'etaient d\'ej\`a habitu\'es, par la culture du palmier \`a huile, \`a l'\'economie bas\'ee sur la vente des r\'ecoltes. Les principaux cultivateurs de cacao qui \'emigr\`erent de cette fa\c{c}on, les Akwapim, ont commenc\'e leur migration vers 1892; ils ont \'et\'e suivis, peu apr\`es, par les Krobo, les Shai, les Ga et d'autres cultivateurs du sud-est du Ghana. Le but de cet article est de pr\'esenter plusieurs cartes des r\'egions d'Akim consacr\'ees \`a la culture du cacao. Ces cartes indiquent les limites des fermes, elles ont \'et\'e dress\'ees en raison des mesures de contr\^ole de la maladie des cacaotiers appel\'ee 'swollen shoot disease'. En vue de l'achat de terrain (mais sans aucune intention d'en faire la culture ensemble) les cultivateurs ont toujours tendance \`a \'emigrer par groupes. Il en existe deux types principaux: le 'groupe de famille' (type caract\'eristique des \'emigrants matrilin\'eaires) et le 'groupe de compagnie' (type qui \'etait primitivement celui des \'emigrants patrilin\'eaires). Puisqu'aucune \'etude anthropologique n'a \'et\'e publi\'ee au sujet des Akwapim patrilin\'eaires (les Guan et les Cheripong), il n'est pas encore possible de comprendre \`a fond l'empressement avec lequel ces peuples ont adopt\'e le syst\`eme de 'groupe de compagnie', qui est devenu finalement le syst\`eme normal d'\'emigration pour tous les peuples vers toutes les r\'egions o\`u les chefs \'etaient dispos\'es \`a vendre du terrain \`a forfait. Mais l'introduction du cacao semble bien avoir entrain\'e des modifications dans les syst\`emes traditionnels d'h\'eritage. En ce qui concerne les cultivateurs de soci\'et\'es matrilin\'eaires, par contre, l'introduction du cacao n'a entra\^in\'e aucune modification importante des syst\`emes de succession et les terrains de la famille.},

Although the first settler is the legitimate owner of a plot of land, his remoteness from the government's administrative center makes it difficult to prove it. This creates incentives for a contestant to dispute his claims. Both contenders will expend resources in order to secure ownership. Due to transport costs, the more remote a plot of land is, the lower its output value; this tends to discourage appropriative activities. Land degradation is sometimes used as a substitute to appropriative activities. A lower discount rate may encourage land degradation.},

We estimate this elasticity from the relationship of rural labour/land ratios and agroclimatic constraints using global district-level data. We find that the elasticity in temperate areas (0.285) is higher than in the tropics (0.126), and that this is not an artefact of the level of development. The land elasticity influences the degree of decreasing returns to labour and capital in agriculture, and thus how sensitive living standards are to shocks in productivity and population. Evidence from the postwar mortality transition supports this prediction.},

In food-producing areas, higher prices reduce conflict over the control of territory (``factor conflict'') and increase conflict over the appropriation of surplus (``output conflict''). We argue that this difference arises because higher prices increase the opportunity cost of soldiering for producers while simultaneously inducing consumers to appropriate surplus as real wages fall. In areas without crop agriculture, higher prices increase both forms of conflict. We validate our local-level findings on output conflict using survey data. Our findings help reconcile a growing but ambiguous literature on the economic roots of conflict.},

  abstract = {The relative advantages of private property and common property for the efficiency, equity, and sustainability of natural resource use patterns have long been debated in the legal and economics literatures. The debate has been clouded by a troika of confusions that relate to the difference between (1) common-property and open-access regimes, (2) common-pool resources and common-property regimes, and (3) a resource system and the flow of resource units. A property right is an enforceable authority to undertake particular actions in specific domains. The rights of access, withdrawal, management, exclusion, and alienation can be separately assigned to different individuals as well as being viewed as a cumulative scale moving from the minimal right of access through possessing full ownership rights. Some attributes of common-pool resources are conducive to the use of communal proprietorship or ownership and others are conducive to individual rights to withdrawal, management, exclusion and alienation. There are, however, no panaceas! No institutions generate better outcomes for the resource and for the users under all conditions. Many of the lessons learned from the operation of communal property regimes related to natural resource systems are theoretically relevant to understanding of a wide diversity of property regimes that are extensively used in modern societies.},
